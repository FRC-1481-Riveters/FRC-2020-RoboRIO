step 1--
     stage 2
        spin the wheel
            greater than 3
            less than 5
            in 4 seconds
            no greater than 1 rotation per second
    stage 3
        detect color
            received by wifi (field management system)
            land on specific color
            in 2 seconds
step 2--
    inputs
       2 buttons tbd
            rotation control
            position control
        color sensor
        encoder (for counting rotations)
        fms communication system
    outputs
        use case 1
            motor
                motor starts by pressing and holding button
                    over the course of 4 seconds
                motor turns off automatically between 3-5 rotations
                vibrates controller for 1 second
        use case 2
            in case wheel is spun incomplete number of times
                motor starts by pressing and holding button
                motor stops after releasing button
    vibrate controller
            vibrates between 3-5 rotations to indicate release of button
