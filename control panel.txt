step 1--
     stage 2
        spin the wheel
            greater than 3
            less than 5
            in 4 seconds
            no greater than 1 rotation per second
    stage 3
        detect color
            received by wifi (field management system)
            land on specific color (under bar sensor not by robot)
            in 2 seconds
step 2--
    inputs
       2 buttons tbd
            rotation control
            position control
        color sensor
        encoder (for counting rotations)
        fms communication system
    outputs
        use case 1(rotational control)
            motor
                motor starts by pressing and holding button
                    over the course of 4 seconds
                motor turns off automatically between 3-5 rotations
                vibrates controller for 1 second
        use case 2(rotational control)
            in case wheel is spun incomplete number of times
                motor starts by pressing and holding button
                motor stops after releasing button
        use case 3(position control)
            motor
                motor starts by pressing and holding button
                    over the course of 2 seconds
                motor will turn off when color is on designated color from FMS
                vibrates  controller for one second (or disco lights) 

    vibrate controller
            vibrates between 3-5 rotations to indicate release of button
