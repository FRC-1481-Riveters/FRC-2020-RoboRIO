step 1--
     stage 2
        spin the wheel
            greater than 3
            less than 5
            in 4 seconds
            no greater than 1 rotation per second
    stage 3
        detect color
            received by wifi (field management system)
            land on specific color (under bar sensor not by robot)
            in 2 seconds
step 2--
    inputs
       2 buttons tbd
            rotation control
            position control
        color sensor
        encoder (for counting rotations)
        fms communication system
    outputs
        use case 1(rotational control)
            motor
                motor starts by pressing and holding button
                    over the course of 4 seconds
                motor turns off automatically between 3-5 rotations
                vibrates controller for 1 second
        use case 2(rotational control)
            in case wheel is spun incomplete number of times
                motor starts by pressing and holding button
                motor stops after releasing button
        use case 3(position control)
            motor
                motor starts by pressing and holding button
                    over the course of 2 seconds
                motor will turn off when color is on designated color from FMS
                vibrates  controller for one second (or disco lights) 

    vibrate controller
            vibrates between 3-5 rotations to indicate release of button
Step 3--
    COMPLETE
Step 4--
    COMPLETE
Step 5--
    RotateOrJogControlPanelCommand: rotates control panel 3>5 times either pressing or holding 
    PositionControlPanelCommand: rotates control panel based on the color chosen by FMS 
Step 6--
steps to a commands life: 
Constructor
    calls "addRequirements" for a subsystem :)
Initiate 
    only gets called once when button is held, motor starts :)
Execute 
    spins control panel :) prob nothing lmao
End
    motor stops :) bRAD STOP 
Is Finished 
    when encoder counts are reached :)
    start controller vibrates :)
    return true :)

    while button is held, execute RotateOrJogControlCommand
        button is held, motor starts at controlPanelSpeedMax
        when controlPanelEncoderCounts is finished
         start vibrate controller controlPanelVibrationTime 
        motor stops 
 
Constructor
    calls "addPrequirements" for colorsensor and wheelOfFortune subsystem
Initiate
    only gets called once when button is held
    read color sensor
    compute "big brain" angle   
    motor starts
Execute
    spins control panel
End
    motor stops
Is Finished
    when designated color is 90 degrees from our sensor  
    controller vibrates
    returns true
Step 7--
COMPLETE
Step 8--
