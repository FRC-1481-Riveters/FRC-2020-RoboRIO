step 1
    vision
        detects target using infared camera and aligns the robot to correctly shoot the power call into the upper port
            how it will do it:
            driver will press button in order to use  align the robot, the infared camera detects reflection tape
           and move into a good spot and shoot from protected target zone and initiation line. 
           use case 1: button gets pressed and robot aligns and shoots fpr upper port
           use case 2: during auton, robot shall use alignment command 
                       then will shoot the power cell from trench
step 2 
    inputs: infared camera, joystick, RPI, gyroscope
    outputs: reflection tape, shows target on screen, infared light??
step 3
    yess did it
step 4
    Constants:
    visionCameraPort = 0;
step 5
    autoassistAlignment: helps align robot so the driver doesn't have to; helps align for better aim
step 6
    Constructor
        calls "addRequirements" for subsystem
    Initiate 
        button gets pressed,
        camera reads matrix,
        choses best contour from restrictions
        makes contour most desirable the target
    Execute
        uses gyroscope to find heading and then PID makes heading equal to desired angle 
        turns to desired angle when driver drives robot forward
    End
        stop running command without stopping drive subsystem
    Is Finished 
        when robot is at desired angle
