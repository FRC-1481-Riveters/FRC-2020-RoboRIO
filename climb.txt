Overview
2 775 motors  in the bottom of the robot
    3 motors possible 4 by states
turns axle connected to pullies on the axle
turn axle to shorten chord and raise elevator
encoder on winch

Hook powered by snow blower motor
    ton of torque- can break
hook is moving vertically ~20 inches by throw of elevator
spring between hook and motor
bidirectional movement to reset when needed
latch keeps robot from falling after power is off

Step 1
elevator
    2 775  motors used to turn axle
        axle is conneced to pullies
        axle shortens cord to raise elevator
        axle unwinds cord to lower elevator
    encoder on winch
        tells how far wound up on winch
        do not overwind winch to avoid breaking robot
    latch keeps robot from falling after power is off
    bidirectional movement to reset if needed
hook
    powered by snow blower motor
    ton of torque- can break
    moves ~20 inches vertically by throw of elevator
        keep in mind when wiring
    spring between hook and motor
    bidirectional movement to reset if needed

    Step 2--
    inputs
       encoder on winch
       button to raise elevator
       button to lower elevator 
       button to engage hook
       button to disengage hook
       winchEncoderReset limit switch

    outputs
     2 775 motors
     snow blower motor
     latch
        (possible automatic latch release)
     
     Step 3--
     DONE
     
     Step 4--
     DONE

     Step 5--
     raiseElevator-- raises elevator, lowers robot
     (automatic latch release)
     lowerElevator --lower elevator, raises robot
     engageUntitledGooseMotor --  engages hook (goose)
     disengageUntitledGooseMotor --  disengages hook (goose)

     Step 6--
raiseElevator
    Constructor
    Initiate 
        winch starts moving
        only gets called once when button is held, motor starts
        when button pressed move
        when button released stop
    Execute 
        if
            button still held
        then
            keep moving

        if
            encoder count = ~500
        then
            release latch
    End
        motor stops when reaching max
            reset counter when reaching top
        or when button released
    Is Finished

        then
            keep moving
    End
        motor stops when reaching min
        or when button released
    Is Finished
        reset counter when reaching bottom
        limit switch/encoder monitors position

engageUntitledGooseMotor
    Constructor
    Initiate
         hook starts moving vertically

        then
            keep moving
    End
        motor stops when reaching max count/limit switch
            talk to FAD/Mr. Gaines about getting encoder/limit switch
        or when button released
    Is Finished
disengageUntitledGooseMotor
    Constructor
    Initiate
         hook starts moving horizontally
        only gets called once when button is held, motor starts
        when button pressed move
        when button released stop
    Execute 
        if
            button still held
        then
            keep moving
