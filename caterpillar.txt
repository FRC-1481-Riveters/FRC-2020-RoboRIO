step 1
    intake
        roller takes balls off the ground/from the lower human player station 
            sends them to the indexer
       requirement load 5 balls in 5 seconds
        motor 1 775 
        optical sensor senses how many balls
    indexer transports balls from intake to shooter
        loads and lines up balls onto conveyor system
        uses 2 belts and a motor
        button jogs balls to top to kicker
       requirement load no more than 5 balls
        1 or 2 motors-- bag or 775
    kicker
        heavy roller
        mechanical pinch point
        takes balls from indexer by rolling
        passes ball to shooter
            rolls at the same time with shooter
        motor 1 bag or 775
    shooter
        heavy roller
        maneuvers balls through hood
        launches ball
        Requirement speed to take Syd's head off (her request not mine) 
        from target zone (week 1) or trench (week 6)
        motor 1 neo for week 1, maybe 2 neos  for week 6/states/worlds
        1 operator button to speed up at initiation line, 1 operator button to speed up for wall shot
        1 driver button to shoot (move kicker/caterpillar)
        continuous shooting as long as button is held
step 2
    inputs
        intake/indexer
            2 buttons for operator
                one in
                one out if jammed
        kicker/shooter
            1 button for operator
                one out to fire
    outputs
        intake
            motor
                spins
        indexer
            motor(s)
                spin indexer motor
            lights
                turn green light bar if 5 balls inside
                maybe turn red if jammed
        kicker
            motor
                spin kicker motor
            optical sensor
                says when ball is in
                stops kicker
        shooter
            motor
                spins 
                    indexer
                    kicker
                    shooter
