STEP 1--
Drives robot
    Uses drive motors
    Input of driver joystick
        Drives robot forward, backwards, left and right
    Includes sensors for different autoassists
    Can use encoders to drive certain distances
STEP 2--
Inputs- controller, encoder
Outputs- motor spins

driveCommandAuton
    distance = m
    speed = m/s
    turning = radians
driveCommandJoystick
    drive backwards at joystick speed = -1
    rest = 0
    drive forward at joystick speed = 1
    drive left at joystick speed = -1
    rest = 0
    drive right at joystick speed = 1
operator interfaces are Joystick and Auton
subsystem is drive
STEP 6--
let forwardReverseSpeed = driverControllerAxisFrontAndBack
let LeftRightSpeed = 0
let Turning/RotationSpeed = driverControllerAxisRotating
If ( driveCommandAuton = false ) then
    driveCommandJoystick ( forwardReverseSpeed, LeftRightSpeed, Turning/RotationSpeed )
Else
driveCommandAuton = true
driveCommandAuton ( distance, speed, turning )
